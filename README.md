Patch - Ergonomic Mocking for Elixir

Patch makes it easy to replace functionality in tests with test specific functionality.  Patch augments ExUnit with several utilities that make writing tests in Elixir fast and easy.  Patch includes unique functionality that no other mocking library for Elixir provides, Patch's [Super Powers](https://hexdocs.pm/patch/super-powers.html).

## Features

Why use Patch instead of meck, Mock, Mockery, Mox, etc?  

Patch starts with a very simple idea for how a patched function should work.

> Patched functions should **always** return the mock value they are given.

Here are the key features of Patch.

1. Easy-to-use and composable interface with sensible defaults.
2. First class support for working with Processes.
3. No testing code in non-test code.

In addition to these features which many libraries aspire to, Patch has 3 additional features that no other mocking library for Elixir / Erlang seem to have.  These [Super Powers](https://hexdocs.pm/patch/super-powers.html) are 

1. Patch mocks are effective for both local and remote calls.  This means a patched function **always** resolves to the patch.
2. Patch can patch private functions without changing their visibility.
3. Patch makes it possible to test your private functions without changing their visibility via the `expose/2` functionality.  

See the [Mockompare](https://github.com/ihumanable/mockompare) companion project for a comparison of Elixir / Erlang mocking libraries.  If there is a way to accomplish the following with another library, please open an issue so this section and the comparisons can be updated.

For more information about Patch's Super Powers see the [Super Powers Documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/patch/super-powers.html)

## Installation

Add patch to your mix.exs

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:patch, "~> 0.12.0", only: [:test]}
  ]
end
```

## Quickstart

After adding the dependency just add the following line to any test module after using your test case

```elixir
use Patch
```

This library comes with a comprehensive suite of unit tests.  These tests not only verify that the library is working correctly but are designed so that for every bit of functionality there is an easy to understand example for how to use that feature.  Check out the [User Tests](https://github.com/ihumanable/patch/tree/master/test/user) for examples of how to use each feature.

Using Patch adds 11 core functions, 10 assertions, 7 mock value builders, and 1 utility function to the test.

See the [Cheatsheet](https://hexdocs.pm/patch/cheatsheet.html) for an overview of how the library can be used and as a handy reference.  Continue below for links to more in-depth documentation including the [Guidebook](https://hexdocs.pm/patch/01-introduction.html).

### Core Functions

Core functions let us apply patches, patch processes, intercept messages, and query our patched modules.

### Value Builders

Patched functions aren't limited to only returning simple scalar values, a host of Value Builders are provided for all kinds of testing scenarios.  See the [patch](https://hexdocs.pm/patch/Patch.html#patch/3) documentation for details.

| Value Builder                                                             | Description                                                                                              |

|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| [debug/0,1](https://hexdocs.pm/patch/Patch.html#debug/1) | Enable or Disable debug mode for a given test |

## Guide Book

Patch comes with [plenty of documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/patch) and a [Suite of User Tests](https://github.com/ihumanable/patch/tree/master/test/user) that show how to use the library.  

For a guided tour and deep dive of Patch, see the [Guide Book](https://hexdocs.pm/patch/01-introduction.html)

## Support Matrix

Tests automatically run against a matrix of OTP and Elixir Versions, see the [ci.yml](https://github.com/ihumanable/patch/tree/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml) for details.

| OTP \ Elixir | 1.7  | 1.8  | 1.9  | 1.10 | 1.11 | 1.12 | 1.13 | 1.14 |
|:------------:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| 20           | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  |
| 21           | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | 
| 22           | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | N/A  |
| 23           | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   |
| 24           | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   |
| 25           | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | N/A   | N/A   | ✅   | ✅   |

## Limitations

Patch works by recompiling modules, this alters the global execution environment. 

Since the global execution environment is altered by Patch, **Patch is not compatible with async: true**.

## Prior Art

Up to version 0.5.0 Patch was based off the excellent [meck](https://hex.pm/packages/meck) library.  Patch [Super Powers](https://hexdocs.pm/patch/super-powers.html) required a custom replacement for meck, `Patch.Mock`.  

Patch also takes inspiration from python's [unittest.mock.patch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#patch) for API design.
